 * Testcase Example:
 * '[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]'
 *
 * Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
 * are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
 * region.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: board =
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Output:
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means
 * that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that
 * is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be
 * flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
 * horizontally or vertically.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["X"]]
 * Output: [["X"]]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
