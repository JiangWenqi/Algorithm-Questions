 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]'
 *
 * You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes
 * connected with node i by an edge.
 *
 * Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start
 * and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may
 * reuse edges.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == graph.length
 * 1 <= n <= 12
 * 0 <= graph[i].length <Â n
 * graph[i] does not contain i.
 * If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
 * The input graph is always connected.
