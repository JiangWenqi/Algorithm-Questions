 *
 * You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a
 * 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi,
 * numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
 *
 *
 * numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
 * numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
 *
 *
 * You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of
 * boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the
 * truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
 *
 * Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: There are:
 * - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
 * - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
 * - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
 * You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the
 * third type.
 * The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
 * Output: 91
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000
 * 1 <= truckSize <= 10^6
 *
