 * Testcase Example:  '3\n[[0,1],[1,2]]\n[]'
 *
 * You are given an integer n, the number of nodes in a directed graph where
 * the nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each edge is red or blue in this
 * graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.
 *
 * You are given two arrays redEdges and blueEdges where:
 *
 *
 * redEdges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a directed red edge from node
 * ai to node bi in the graph, and
 * blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj] indicates that there is a directed blue edge from
 * node uj to node vj in the graph.
 *
 *
 * Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[x] is the length of
 * the shortest path from node 0 to node x such that the edge colors alternate
 * along the path, or -1 if such a path does not exist.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blueEdges = []
 * Output: [0,1,-1]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1]], blueEdges = [[2,1]]
 * Output: [0,1,-1]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= redEdges.length,Â blueEdges.length <= 400
 * redEdges[i].length == blueEdges[j].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj < n
